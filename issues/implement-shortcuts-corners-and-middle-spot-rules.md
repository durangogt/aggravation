### Feature Request: Implement Shortcuts for Corners and Middle Spot

#### Description:
Enhance the gameplay in the `aggravation` repository by implementing the shortcut routes described in the game rules. This includes:

1. **Corners:**
   - Enable players to take shortcuts by cutting corners when a piece lands precisely on a corner square. The piece should follow the path outlined in the rules to jump to the next corner.

2. **Middle Spot:**
   - Introduce a gameplay rule that allows players to take advantage of the middle spot. Pieces should be able to use the middle spot for a shortcut when the conditions in the rules are met.

#### Requirements:
- Please ensure that the implementation aligns with the rules outlined in the repository documentation.
- Update game logic to support these shortcuts.
- Validate the conditions for triggering shortcut rules to ensure 100% accuracy.

#### References:
- Refer to [copilot-instructions.md](https://github.com/durangogt/aggravation/blob/main/.github/copilot-instructions.md) for detailed guidelines and rules regarding shortcuts.

#### Deliverables:
1. Updates to gameplay code to support new routing logic for corners and middle spots.
2. Comments/documentation in the code to explain the implementation.
3. Unit tests to validate the new shortcut functionality.

#### Priority Level:
Medium

Please provide updates on the current progress and let us know if there are any challenges during implementation.
