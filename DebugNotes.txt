* roll of 2 and it wasn't valid but went anyways...zero in home

* start occupied - true 
-------------------------
* roll of 5
* 2 in home
* marble on start & pos.3 
* clicking on start marble - should show can't move - works
--------------------------
* then roll of 1
* 2 in home
* 1 marble on start
* 1 marble on 8
*  [(None, None), (None, None), (23, 6), (19, 2)]
* clicked on marble on start but it says it can't due to (19,2) - sooo, the problem happened immedietly:
   * initally clicked on roll 1 then next roll seemed to move it but then the marble tracking didn't update after that...added better logging to see more - need more around; num in home, num on board, p1marbles, choice(true | false), etc...
--------------------------
another problem more reproducible:
2 in home
1 at start
1 at 7 spot
* user choice, click on start marble & get error saying can't make move due to marble on
